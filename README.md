# Anti-Virus-game-solver
Solver for the Anti-Virus® game by SmartGames®.

* antivirus_solver.py contains the main class, allowing to define and solve an instance of Anti-Virus® game.

* problem_creator.py is a script to generate random problems for the Anti-Virus® game.

* equivalence_classes.py is a script to count equivalence classes given a set of tiles and orientations.

Note that this is *not* an interface to play Anti-Virus®. There is no GUI allowing a user to move the tiles. Its display capabilities are limited to showing an initial position, and displaying the found solution.

This code is dedicated to Coco :)
